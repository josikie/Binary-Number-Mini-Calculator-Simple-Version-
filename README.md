## Binary Number Mini Calculator (Simple Version on C++)

### Introduction

Binary Number Mini Calculator is an application that can calculate addition of two binary numbers for you. A new binary number will appear as the result of the addition. This is the simple version of Binary Number Mini Calculator that I've been working on lately. However, this application built with C++. The Binary Number Mini Calculater is not build by C++.

### Run locally

1. Make sure you have g++ compiler on your PC. Check it with this command:
```bash
    g++ --version
```
2. Check your C++ version whether its C++11, C++14, or C++17, and so on : [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n6vGnJ7B8E). I prefer C++11 and above C++11.

3. Clone this project. 

4. Open terminal within the cloned project folder. 

5. Run this command on the terminal:
```bash
    g++ addBinaryNumbers.cpp
```
Windows:
```bash
    ./a.exe
```
Mac/Linux/Unix based OS:
```bash
    ./a.out
```

You can change the binary numbers at addBinaryNumbers.cpp `std::cout << cbn.addBinaryNumbers("1011", "10111");`.
